## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to **llm_intercept**! This tool helps you capture and store interactions with large language models (LLMs). You can collect data needed for fine-tuning smaller models. This process can make your models cheaper and faster to use.

## 📋 System Requirements

Ensure you have the following before downloading:

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.14 or later, or a recent version of Linux.
- **Memory**: At least 4 GB of RAM.
- **Disk Space**: 200 MB of free space for installation.
- **Network**: Internet access to connect with LLM APIs.

## 🌐 How It Works

Here’s a simple guide on how to use **llm_intercept**:

1. **Use an LLM**: Start by integrating an OpenAI-compatible API in your application to perform your tasks.
2. **Run Through LLM Intercept**: Direct your API calls through **llm_intercept** to log the interactions.
3. **Export Your Data**: After logging, you can export your dataset in a clean format, such as parquet, with options to remove system prompts.
4. **Fine-Tune Your Model**: Use the collected dataset to train your compact model.
5. **Replace the LLM**: Switch from the large language model to your fine-tuned model. This transition can save you time and costs, allowing for easier local deployments.
6. **Enjoy the Benefits**: Experience improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness with your new model.
